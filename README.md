# Explorio

This project's purpose is to explore blockchain technology, specifically by developing a Solana Program using the [Anchor framework](https://book.anchor-lang.com/introduction/what_is_anchor.html).

The protocol's name is Explorio, and is an experiment in creating real value for NFTs through a non-interactive game protocol which drives users to use both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to engage with the protocol, the marketplace, and through these two pathways create a small but functional economy around the gameâ€™s assets.

## Run
There are two parts to this - the blockchain program (contract) and the frontend.

### Frontend
to build the front end:
```
cd app/ && npm install && npm start
```

### Program
Deploying the backend locally requires an understanding of how to set up a solana test validator as well as how to test and deploy anchor programs. For more information, see the Anchor framework link above as well as the [Solana developer docs](https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator).
