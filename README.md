# Explorio

This project's purpose is to explore blockchain technology, specifically by developing a Solana Program using the [Anchor framework](https://book.anchor-lang.com/introduction/what_is_anchor.html).

The protocol's name is Explorio, and is an experiment in creating real value for NFTs through a non-interactive game protocol which drives users to use both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to engage with the main protocol, the marketplace, and through these two pathways create a small but functional economy around the gameâ€™s assets.
